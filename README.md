This repository was created as part of our GIS course Lab project at Politecnico di Milano, focusing on web GIS. Our group consists of Bahman Amirsardari, Milad Ramezani Ziarani, and Mohammad Kordgholiabad.

Our project aims to map landslide susceptibility and conduct exposure assessment in the Como region of Italy. The outcomes of our project have been presented in the form of a website. In the Web GIS section, you can explore the final results displayed on the map.

We are excited to share our work with you and invite you to explore the project and its findings. Feel free to provide any feedback or suggestions.

Thank you for visiting our repository!
